### Greetings internet traveller 👋

Below are some things I am working on

- 💻 I’m currently studying for my AWS Associate Developer, and AWS Associate Solutions Architect Certifications.
- 👨‍🌾 I’m currently gardening on about ~250 square feet of fruits, vegetables, flowers, fruit trees, and learning how to grow food for people, and bees.
- 📖 I'm currently re-reading [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).
- 🌎 I’m looking to collaborate and share ways to make humanity more joyful, and [anti-fragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility).
- 💧 This is a reminder to drink water if that sounds good, and possibly bring a cup to someone else that may need one.

I wish you the best! 🙏
